				<p>Welcome to the Game 2+ is a mod for the game by the same name that adds a variety of new mechanics, websites, and enemies to keep the game interesting even after you have mastered the main game.</p>
				<details>
					<summary><h4>Twitch Integration</h4></summary>
					<p>Do you have people watching you? What if they were more than that? What if you handed them some of the strings? Would they be kind to you? Would you like to find out?</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary><h4>New Enemies</h4></summary>
					<p>The mod adds new enemies you can activate if you are not careful. Will you disappoint the Bomb Maker or come face to face with Tanner? Do you want to find out?</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary><h4>New Items</h4></summary>
					<p>Perhaps you'd like to upgrade your VPNs? How about lower the chance the police will bust down your door? Maybe the new items will help you avoid a less than ideal fate...</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary><h4>New Viruses</h4></summary>
					<p>As you connect to your once safe network you see your balance start to drain... Do you also hear the beeping in the background? Perhaps you should do something about that...</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary><h4>New Websites</h4></summary>
					<p>Throwbacks to the original mixed with some things new. A good old mixing pot of sites from wttg1, wttg2, custom sites, and some inspired by the real web...</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary><h4>And More</h4></summary>
					<p>What was that sound? Was it your imagination... or was it real... There it is again! Something is watching you, but what or who could it be...</p>
